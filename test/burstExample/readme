To compile the example run:

gcc burst.c -lm -lncurses -ltinfo -o burst

Note that this is not the exact same analysis that is done 
here but our method should capture all of the bursts found 
using this method.  The difference is that our method will 
also capture smaller bursts that are missed with the 
reference method.
