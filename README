Developed as part of the DARPA SyNAPSE program, the 
HRLAnalysis package was initially created as an implementation 
of off-line visualization of spiking and network data for use with 
HRLSim(TM).  To balance efficiency with usability, the 
extraction and analysis of the simulation data is performed in C++ 
and the plotting and further manipulation is handled in Python 
through the Boost package.  With this, users get the performance 
benefits of C++ but also the feature rich and syntactically simple 
interface of Python.  In addition, users can take advantage of the 
extensive libraries available to Python for further manipulation 
and visualization of the results.

HRLAnalysis is currently supported by Corey M. Thibeault and
Michael J. O'Brien.  The initially design and development was 
completed by Corey M. Thibeault.  The membrane voltage analysis 
and extra plotting functionality was developed by Micheal O'Brien.
